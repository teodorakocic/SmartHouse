## ü§ñ Why TOAST UI Editor?

TOAST UI Editor provides **Markdown mode** and **WYSIWYG mode**. Depending on the type of use you want like production of *Markdown* or maybe to just edit the *Markdown*. The TOAST UI Editor can be helpful for both the usage. It offers **Markdown mode** and **WYSIWYG mode**, which can be switched any point in time.

### Productive Markdown Mode

![markdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37766175/121464762-71e2fc80-c9ef-11eb-9a0a-7b06e08d3ccb.png)

**CommonMark + GFM Specifications**

Today *CommonMark* is the de-facto *Markdown* standard. *GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)* is another popular specification based on *CommonMark* - maintained by *GitHub*, which is the *Markdown* mostly used. TOAST UI Editor follows both [*CommonMark*](http://commonmark.org/) and [*GFM*](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specifications. Write documents with ease using productive tools provided by TOAST UI Editor and you can easily open the produced document wherever the specifications are supported.

* **Live Preview** : Edit Markdown while keeping an eye on the rendered HTML. Your edits will be applied immediately.
* **Scroll Sync** : Synchronous scrolling between Markdown and Preview. You don't need to scroll through each one separately.
* **Syntax Highlight** : You can check broken Markdown syntax immediately.

### Easy WYSIWYG Mode

![wysiwyg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37766175/121808381-251f5000-cc93-11eb-8c47-4f5a809de2b3.png)

* **Table** : Through the context menu of the table, you can add or delete columns or rows of the table, and you can also arrange text in cells.
* **Custom Block Editor** : The custom block area can be edited through the internal editor.
* **Copy and Paste** : Paste anything from browser, screenshot, excel, powerpoint, etc.

### UI
* **Toolbar** : Through the toolbar, you can style or add elements to the document you are editing.

* **Dark Theme** : You can use the dark theme.

### Use of Various Extended Functions - Plugins

![plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37766175/121808323-d8d41000-cc92-11eb-9117-b92a435c9b43.png)

CommonMark and GFM are great, but we often need more abstraction. The TOAST UI Editor comes with powerful **Plugins** in compliance with the Markdown syntax.

**Five basic plugins** are provided as follows, and can be downloaded and used with npm.

* [**`chart`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/chart) : A code block marked as a 'chart' will render [TOAST UI Chart](https://github.com/nhn/tui.chart).
* [**`code-syntax-highlight`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/code-syntax-highlight) : Highlight the code block area corresponding to the language provided by [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).
* [**`color-syntax`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/color-syntax) : 
Using [TOAST UI ColorPicker](https://github.com/nhn/tui.color-picker), you can change the color of the editing text with the GUI.
* [**`table-merged-cell`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/table-merged-cell) : 
You can merge columns of the table header and body area.
* [**`uml`**](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/plugins/uml) : A code block marked as an 'uml' will render [UML diagrams](http://plantuml.com/screenshot).

## üé® Features

* [Viewer](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/viewer.md) : Supports a mode to display only markdown data without an editing area.
* [Internationalization (i18n)](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/i18n.md) : Supports English, Dutch, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Ukrainian, Turkish, Finnish, Czech, Arabic, Polish, Galician, Swedish, Italian, Norwegian, Croatian + language and you can extend.
* [Widget](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/widget.md) : This feature allows you to configure the rules that replaces the string matching to a specific `RegExp` with the widget node.
* [Custom Block](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/docs/en/custom-block.md) : Nodes not supported by Markdown can be defined through custom block. You can display the node what you want through writing the parsing logic with custom block.

## üîß Pull Request Steps

TOAST UI products are open source, so you can create a pull request(PR) after you fix issues. Run npm scripts and develop yourself with the following process.

### Setup

Fork `main` branch into your personal repository. Clone it to local computer. Install node modules. Before starting development, you should check if there are any errors.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-personal-repo}/tui.editor.git
$ npm install
$ npm run build toastmark
$ npm run test editor
```

> TOAST UI Editor uses [npm workspace](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/), so you need to set the environment based on [npm7](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/). If subversion is used, dependencies must be installed by moving direct paths per package.

### Develop

You can see your code reflected as soon as you save the code by running a server. Don't miss adding test cases and then make green rights.

#### Run snowpack-dev-server
[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) allows you to run a development server without bundling.

``` sh
$ npm run serve editor
```

#### Run webpack-dev-server
If testing of legacy browsers is required, the development server can still be run using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

``` sh
$ npm run serve:ie editor
```

#### Run test

``` sh
$ npm test editor
```

### Pull Request

Before uploading your PR, run test one last time to check if there are any errors. If it has no errors, commit and then push it!
